High-level roadmap (backend → frontend cohesion)

Each phase below is self-contained: implement backend APIs + DB model → immediately implement frontend UI, hooks, types, tests and monitoring for that feature.

Auth (DONE)

Backend: register, login, profile, hashing, conflict handling.

Frontend: AuthContext, register/login forms, local session, protected routes.

Users / Admin list (DONE / partial)

Backend: GET /users (pagination, role filter), CRUD.

Frontend: admin users table, pagination, filters, actions.

Products / Catalog (NEXT — recommended) ← Core for e-commerce

Backend: Product model, CRUD, filtering, pagination, categories, search.

Frontend: product listing, product detail, product create/edit (admin), hooks, optimistic UI.

Cart & Orders

Backend: cart endpoints, order creation, status updates.

Frontend: cart UI, checkout flow, order history, order detail.

Payments

Backend: payment intent endpoints, webhooks.

Frontend: checkout integration, token handling, secure flows.

Admin & RBAC

Backend: roles, guards, admin-only endpoints, audit logs.

Frontend: admin panel, role-aware UI, server-side checks.

Media / File Uploads & CDN

Backend: signed upload URLs, image processing.

Frontend: upload UI, previews, progress, CDN URLs.

Search & Filters

Backend: optimized search (Elastic/Typesense) or DB full-text, facets.

Frontend: filter drawer, search-as-you-type, debounce, analytics.

Notifications / Emails

Backend: email verification, transactional email, push/Socket.

Frontend: verification flows, notification center, toasts.

Observability / Security / CI

Backend/infra: metrics, logs (Prometheus/Grafana), rate limiting, WAF, secrets.

Frontend: source map upload, Sentry, CI tests, e2e.

Phase template (what to do for every phase)

When you pick a phase use this checklist.

Backend

Add Prisma model + migration.

Create DTOs (class-validator) + Controller + Service.

Add RBAC/guards if needed.

Add unit tests for service and integration tests for controller.

Add OpenAPI (NestJS Swagger) for contract.

Add error handling (400,401,403,404,409,500).

Frontend

Add types to lib/types/* (or share via package).

Add API helpers (lib/api.ts).

Add React Query hooks (useProducts, useCreateProduct, etc).

Add pages/components/forms (react-hook-form + validation).

Add loading, skeletons, error UI, success toasts.

Add unit + e2e tests (Jest, Cypress).

Accessibility checks & responsive design.

Contract

Add example request/response in docs (postman/Swagger/openapi).

Make sure error shapes are consistent: { message: string; details?: any }.
